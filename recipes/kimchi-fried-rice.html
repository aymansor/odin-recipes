        <li>2 cups day-old cooked white rice (rice that has been cooked
            <br>and cooled in the fridge for at least an hour or overnight)</li>

        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper , to taste</li>
        <li>2 green onions , chopped</li>
        <li>Sriracha hot sauce , for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a wok or large fry pan over medium-high heat.

            <br>saute for 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Add chopped kimchi and toss for 1 minute. Separate the cold,
            <br>cooked rice kernels with your fingers and add to the pan.

        <li>Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, black pepper, and 1 chopped

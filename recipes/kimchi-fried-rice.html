            <li>1-2 Tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce , or more, to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper , to taste</li>
            <li>2 green onions , chopped</li>
            <li>Sriracha hot sauce , for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>#Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add oil to a wok or large fry pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add
                 onion and cook for 2 minutes. Add garlic and saute for 30 seconds. </li>
            <li>Add chopped kimchi and toss for 1 minute. Separate the cold, cooked rice
                kernels with your fingers and add to the pan. Toss gently to combine. </li>
            <li>Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, black pepper, and 1 chopped green onion. Toss
                gently to combine (you don't want to over-stir the rice and make it mushy). </li>
            <li>Taste and add pepper, salt or more soy sauce, as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately garnished with additional green onion and sriracha hot sauce.
